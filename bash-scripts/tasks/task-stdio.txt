create a script that does the following:

asks the user to input a filename
writes the following poem to the file specified by user:
An old silent pond...
A frog jumps into the pond,
splash! Silence again.

Autumn moonlight-
a worm digs silently
into the chestnut.

In the twilight rain
these brilliant-hued hibiscus -
A lovely sunset.

outputs the poem to the terminal
outputs the message "Task finished" to stderr
- run your script, specify output as the file to write the poem to, redirect stdout to /dev/null, redirect stderr to stderr file

Self-check:

- script returns no output

- cat output command returns:

An old silent pond...
A frog jumps into the pond,
splash! Silence again.

Autumn moonlight-
a worm digs silently
into the chestnut.

In the twilight rain
these brilliant-hued hibiscus -
A lovely sunset.

- cat stderr command returns:

Task finished

read FILENAME < /dev/tty
